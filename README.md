This Python script utilizes Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to predict stock prices. It downloads historical stock data for Apple Inc. (AAPL) from Yahoo Finance, preprocesses the data, trains an LSTM model, and makes predictions. The code includes visualization of historical stock prices, model predictions, and evaluation using Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
